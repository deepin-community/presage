Prompter is a simple predictive text editor, written to demonstrate
the use of presage, the intelligent predictive text entry system.
.PP
Begin editing. While editing, prompter uses presage to generate
predictions and displays them in a pop\-up prediction list. If the
desired text is displayed in the prediction list, select it by double
clicking on it or by highlighting it with the arrow keys and then
pressing ENTER; the desired text will be automatically entered.
